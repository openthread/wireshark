    6LoWPAN: IPv6 Fragment Headers don't have a Length field
    
    RFC 6282 specifies special handling of the "Length" field in compressed
    IPv6 extension headers. However, the Fragment Header does not have a
    Length field, so this special handling does not apply - the second octet
    should be treated as opaque data, and the header length is always 8
    octets.

    Don't check the radio information when testing for an HT Control header.
    
    I now read 8.2.4.1.10 "Order field" in 802.11-2012 as saying that, in
    management and QoS data frames, the Order bit shouldn't be set for
    non-HT, non-VHT frames, so we can just test it for those frame types
    without bothering to check the radio metadata to see if the frame is an
    HT or VHT frame.
    
    This handles cases where the radio metadata isn't complete, e.g. an HT
    frame with a radiotap header but no MCS field.
    
    Handle this for *all* QoS data frames when capturing.
    
    Get rid of the "fixed-length link-layer header" stuff; it's not being
    used.

    Speed up column sorting.
    
    The GTK+ UI sequentially dissects and caches column strings for all rows
    before sorting a column. Do the same in the Qt UI, which can improve
    performance considerably.
    
    Don't colorize packets when sorting in the Qt UI unless it's necessary.
    
    When sorting in the Qt UI, let the user cancel the initial packet
    dissection.  Note that we'll need to replace std::sort in order to
    cancel out of sorting.
    
    Use a pre-allocated and pre-compiled GRexex when we prime columns. Note
    that we probably shouldn't parse a regular expression there.
    
    Cache the last result of proto_registrar_get_byname.

    RADIUS: Validation of response authenticators
    
    This patch enables validation of response authenticator messages when
    the shared secret is known.
    The validation can be activated in the preferences.
    It implements the validation protocol described in RFC 2865 page 16: Response Authenticator.
    When an authenticator is invalid, the information is added in the header information.
    It adds two flags for the display filter : radius.authenticator.valid and
    radius.authenticator.invalid: since verification is not always possible we use
    two flags to determine if the verification has been made or not, in the same way as
    udp and tcp checksum validation is implemented.
    The Authenticator field becomes a tree, and the value of the flags are visible in
    this tree.

    Remove calls of tvb_ensure_length_remaining.
    
    The remaining calls seem to fall into 3 categories:
    1. passing it to tvb_find_line_end when -1 (for length) will do.
    2. duplicating the checking of tvb_reported_length_remaining, which is already in use near the tvb_ensure_length_remaining call.
    3. Those that (probably) need tvb_ensure_capture_length_remaining

    bootp/dhcp: tighten check for Alcatel extensions
    
    The check for Alcatel extensions in bootp/dhcp packets is very weak,
    resulting in some false positives.  Then when trying to parse the
    suboptions, the result is an error on the packet.
    
    This change eliminates some false positives by adding a test that the
    vendor-specific option contents match the encapsulated format described
    in section 8.4 of RFC2132.

    When parsing TDLS direct link packets the ToDS: 0 and FromDS:0
    so the wireshark treats the 4th bit in QoS Control as "bit4", but it
    should be treated as EOSP.
    
    So changed the default case to EOSP and only when TODS is set
    treat it as "bit4".

    This would give a feature where the user is able to compare packets
    before and after a reload.
    
    Or we could add functions in PacketDialog to reload the packet details
    in all open dialogs.  This would give a feature to always have a
    updated dialog for all interesting packets.

    When changing stream in TCPStreamDialog it should not be possible
    to change stream again until the capture has reloaded, because
    this will give a crash when doing graph_segment_list_free() or
    graph_segment_list_get() while already doing this.
    
    Also disable mouseMove event (showing packet details) while reloading,
    as this also will give a crash.
    
    We should consider also having a reload progress bar in the
    TCPStreamDialog to indicate that this is happening when having
    large capture files, as the main window may not be visible.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun Aug 23 11:38:13 2015 -0700

    See if this makes MSVC happy.
    
    It's complaining about an "overflow in constant arithmetic".  Neither
    INFINITY nor NAN are specified by C90; C99 specifies that they are both
    floats.  Until recently, Microsoft had no interest in C99; if the
    version we're using supports C99's INFINITY and NAN, it should be OK to
    assign them to a variable (no "arithmetic" involved), so I'm guessing
    that the "arithmetic" in question is the use of conditional operators ?
    and :, so I'm writing it as an if statement instead.

    dtls: do not try to add a zero-length fragment
    
    fragment_add does not like adding zero-length fragments, it causes a
    zero-length memcpy to NULL.
    
    According to RFC 6347, fragment_offset=0 and fragment_length=length is
    an unfragmented message, so fragment>0 and fragment_length=length=0 is a
    fragmented message.
    
    An empty fragment does not extend a previous message, so ignore it.
    Such fragments are produced by at least GnuTLS 3.3.7[1], so raise a
    warning instead of an error.

    Yes, it *should* have been called "HT", but hindsight is always 20-20.
    
    If you want less confusingly named information, look at what the "802.11

    dissection is for people debugging radiotap implementations or looking
    for vendor-specific information that's not (yet) put into the generic

Date:   Thu Aug 13 18:13:45 2015 +0300

    Allow redefining all ports for RADIUS
    
    RADIUS configuration sometimes uses more ports - for example, one for
    authentication, another one for accounting. Sometimes it uses the entire
    port ranges. In case of FreeRADIUS 2.x.x server it might look like this:
    
    ...
    listen {
            type = auth
            ipaddr = *
            port = 13812
    }
    listen {
            type = acct
            ipaddr = *
            port = 13813
    }
    ...
    
    Unfortunately we allow only one port to be redefined, not more. So it
    forces a person who's analyzing a traffic from such a RADIUS server
    manually select "Decode as" every time for each port.
    
    It was requested at least once to lift this limitation:
    
    * https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/2189/decode-multiple-ports-as-radius
    
    So let's fix it!
    
    With this commit it's possible to set a port ranges for RADIUS dissector
    to handle. An example (default) configuration looks like (see
    ~/.wireshark/preferences):
    
    radius.ports: 1645,1646,1700,1812,1813,3799
    
    Old "alternate_port" preference is marked as obsolete. It won't be shown
    to a user but it will still be used if exists (remained from a previous
    installations).
    
    *Ver. 2*:
    Old alternate_port value is copied to the ports range, thus making
    transition even more smooth.

    The "Syntax Line Edit" is based on "QLineEdit". By default, the maximum
    permitted length of a QLineEdit text is 32767 (16 bits).
    
    As the "Host Flows" extension uses the Wireshark filter syntax to filter
    the data, the filter can be become large. To avoid errors, I increased
    the maximum permitted length value to the maximum of quint32.

commit 2ed3d91
Author: Gerald Combs <gerald@wireshark.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 18 11:46:12 2015 -0700

    Add the WLAN statistics dialog.
    
    Instead of splitting the stats into two lists as with the GTK+ UI, add
    everything to an expandable tree. This allows viewing nodes on more than
    one network.
    
    Rename the top-level Bluetooth menu item to Wireless and put the WLAN
    stats dialog there.
    
    The Qt UI matches SSIDs (WlanNetworkTreeWidgetItem::isMatch) a bit
    differently than the GTK+ UI. Try to make the logic as plain as possible
    since we'll likely have to update it in the future.
    
    The addition of a custom BSSID address types means that we can't assume
    that everything is AT_ETHER. Add routines for checking for broadcast
    BSSIDs and comparing only the data portions of addresses.
    
    Move PercentBarDelegate into its own module. Use it in
    WlanStatisticsDialog.

    Tap parameter and stats dialog fixups.
    
    If we run into an error when trying to register a tap listener, return
    instead of tapping packets. This should fix some (but likely not all)
    double frees found by Stig. For now close each statistics dialog if we
    find an error. Note that we might want to keep them open instead.
    
    Add checks and cleanups to some of the stats table free routines.
    
    Call fillTree once in TapParameterDialog's constructor instead of each
    time it's shown. Make fillTree a slot which lets us use a delay timer so
    that the dialog is visible when we retap packets.

    Preparation Host Flows: Tap Sequence Analysis
    
    The tap_sequence_analysis was adapted to store the protocol of each
    frame. Therefore a new variable was introduced. In case of an ICMP or
    ICMPv6 packet, the ICMP message type and code is retrieved. The adapted
    ICMP and ICMPv6 dissector stores both values in packet info (see [1]).
    
    In case of ICMP and ICMPv6 packets, the source and destination port is
    not set or 0, respectively. Compared to that, the NetFlow service export
    protocol [2] codes the ICMP message type and code into the port numbers.
    The source port is zero while the destination is defined as: destination
    port = ICMP type * 256 + ICMP code. This definition was implemented for
    the ICMP and ICMPv6 packets.

    Recompile dfilter for all tap listeners when fields changed
    
    When fields have changed the compiled display filter may be invalid
    or need a recompile to be valid.
    
    Filters which are not valid after a recompile is set to a filter
    matching no packets (frame.number == 0) to indicate that this does
    no longer match anything.  We should probably have a better filter
    matching no packet for this purpose.

    ORing in the low part; no need to play games with unions and byte order

    Improve file merging for mergecap and wireshark
    
    Refactor the file merging code by removing the duplicate logic from mergecap.c
    and file.c's cf_merge_files(), into a new merge_files() function in merge.c.
    Also the following user-visible changes:
    
     * Removed the '-T' encap type option from mergecap, as it's illogical for
       mergecap and would complicate common merge code.
    
     * Input files with IDBs of different name, speed, tsprecision, etc., will produce
       an output PCAPNG file with separate IDBs, even if their encap types are the same.
    
     * Added a '-I' IDB merge mode option for mergecap, to control how IDBs are merged.
    
     * Changed Wireshark's drag-and-drop merging to use PCAPNG instead of PCAP.

    A new Early Allocation Request for draft-ietf-pce-lsp-setup-type and

    https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/pce/Zdsc0HHl1SLvpANRWhpLvIzJQyI
    There are implementations out there that are using 5 as SR-ERO subobject
    identifier (instead of 36 that will be assigned by IANA) and 27 as the
    PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV identifier (instead of 28 that will be assigned by
    IANA).  This patch decodes both 5/36 as SR-ERO subobject and 27/28 as
    PATH-SETUP-TYPE.  It is unlikely that IANA will re-assign code points 5
    and 27 in the near future.

    AMQP 1.0: Refactor to fix parsing of timestamps
    
    Timestamps are currently dissected as integer numbers; two aspects need to
    be recatored to correctly dissect timestamps:
     - the add_1_0_proto_item() function
     - protocol fields (hf_xxx) and the get_amqp_1_0_value_formatter()
    
    (1)
    The AMQP 1.0 dissector rely on the proto_tree_add_item. There is only one
    invocation common for all datatypes (in add_1_0_proto_item), which cannot
    pass any type-specific ENC_xxx specifiers and it cannot handle custom
    datatypes like AMQP timestamp.
    
    I propose to replace the add_1_0_proto_item() by type-specific dissectors that
    will correctly set the ENC_xxx specifiers and handle exceptional cases like
    the AMQP timestamp or the zero-length true/false datatypes.
    
    (2)
    The get_amqp_1_0_value_formatter implements a table-driven magic to select
    alternate hf_xxx field based on the actual datatype. This however
     - defines alternate fields where the standard permits only one datatype
     - does not support fields that can contain any datatype ("*")
     - does not support FT_TIMESTAMP
    
    I propose to make this mechanism less table-driven (more explicit and more
    flexible) and allow all alternates permitted by the standard.

Date:   Sat Aug 15 11:34:46 2015 -0700

    Un-reference actions after adding them to an action group.
    
    When created, they have a reference count of 1; when added to an action
    group, the reference count is increased as a pointer is held by the
    action group.  Release the reference we got, as we're not holding onto
    it.
    
    Also, rename "menu_item" to "menu_action", to indicate that it's an action.

    Do the "plugin" menu stuff in one pass.
    
    Also, use g_strconcat() in other places where we prepend / to action
    names.
    
    Hopefully, this will make it easier to find common code between all the
    N different places where we add menus and menu items.

    Action names are expected to begin with /, so prepend a /.
    
    Fixes the "plugin" menu mechanism (which could be used by built-in code
    as well, so it's not really a "plugin" menu mechanism).

    Update the previously-added comment.
    
    At least with kqueues, NOTE_REVOKE is delivered if the file system
    containing the vnode in question is unmounted, and that gets mapped to a
    change notification by QFileSystemWatcher, so the right thing should
    happen.
    
    I'm not sure whether the right thing happens on Windows.

    https://ask.wireshark.org/questions/45036/permanent-smb2-traffic-with-1997
    
    and that's due to said polling.  On the main desktop platforms (Windows,
    OS X, Linux) we can use QFileSystemWatcher plus, on Windows and OS X,
    some additional stuff to check for unmounts (and get FreeBSD as a
    freebie, as it works the same as OS X), and avoid timeout-based polling.

    Clean up heuristic checks.
    
    Fix heuristic checks to handle sliced packets correctly.  "Correctly"
    means "fail the heuristic", as the heuristic checks every single byte of
    the putative Ixia trailer, as one thing it does is check the checksum,
    which is in the last 2 bytes of the trailer and checks everything before
    it.  So just return 0 if the full trailer isn't part of the captured
    data.
    
    Try to handle being handed a tvbuff that contains an FCS by looking at
    the putative "magic number" locations where it would be if the tvbuff
    didn't include the FCS and, if that doesn't match, where it would be if
    it *did* include the FCS.  If the former doesn't match but the latter
    does, assume that means it does include the FCS, and do all other
    processing under that assumption.
    
    Clean up some comments.
    
    Fix an hf_ variable name to match the field name, and put the tvbuff
    value fields in the order of their types.
    
    Don't fail if the field length is 0 - it's a value length, so it could
    in theory be 0.  Rely on the length checks for individual types to catch
    problems.

    Format is as follow:
      Fields	Trailer Length	0xAF12(Signature)	Trailer Checksum
    
    The fields portion of the trailer is a series of 2-byte fields followed by variable
    length data. The first byte indicates the field type, the 2nd byte indicates the
    field length.   The values supported are listed below:
    	1	Reserved (Original Packet Size)
    	3	Timestamp (From Local Timebase)
    	4	Timestamp (From NTP source)
    	5	Timestamp (From GPS)

    Add DCE-RPC and ONC-RPC service response time dialogs.
    
    Add RpcServiceResponseTimeDialog, which handles DCE-RPC and ONC-RPC
    service response time statistics. Try to make it as lightweight as
    possible, since we might want to pull this into the RPC dissectors
    similar to the other SRT statistics.
    
    Allow program names on the command line in place of numbers or UUIDs. Make
    matches case-insensitive. E.g. the following are equivalent:
    
        -z rpc,srt,100003,3
        -z rpc,srt,nfs,3
        -z rpc,srt,NFS,3
    
    as are the following:
    
        -z dcerpc,srt,f5cc5a18-4264-101a-8c59-08002b2f8426,56
        -z dcerpc,srt,nspi,56

    Expert information dialog performance improvements.
    
    Inserting QTreeWidgetItems individually is slow. This isn't a problem if
    you only have a few items but the Expert Information dialog can have
    thousands. Add "packet" tree items in groups, which should be much
    faster. Note that we still add "group" tree items individually since
    that gives us a nice progress indicator.
    
    While we're here, make sure we show the dialog before tapping packets.

    Don't try to decrypt the payload if it was cut short by the snapshot length.
    
    It's not clear that the decryption code can handle an incomplete
    payload.  If it can, please fix this (bear in mind that you won't have
    all the MIC, and may not have *any* of the MIC, so...).

    Use the reported length where appropriate.
    
    Use the captured length to know how much data to decrypt.  Use the
    reported length to determine whether we have a null payload and to se
    the reported length of the decrypted payload and of tvbuffs for the
    un-decrypted payload.

Date:   Mon Aug 10 00:00:21 2015 +0200

    use the captured length as payload length for zigbee decryption
    
    this length is used for allocating a buffer and for crypto calculations
    we should use the bytes that were actually captured, not the reported
    length
    
    the capture in https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11389
    has one packet with a stupidly large reported length and a reasonable
    capture length (and one completely bogus packet) - this fix ensures that
    the decryption does not break for the former packet
    
    also, tvb_reported_length_remaining() does not return values < 0 any
    more, remove the check for this

     Replace a tab by spaces;
     Change editor tab-width specification to be 8 (not 2). No actual

Date:   Fri Aug 7 08:39:09 2015 -0700

    Switch the floats in stat_tap table items to doubles.
    
    Use doubles instead of floats in stat_tap_table_item_type. This should
    make stat taps easier to use with a lot of our API (e.g. nstime) along
    with Qt and the C math library.
    
    This reverts commit 5bbb6ff5e43511ddc57b0b771f3d60da1eb82c02.

Date:   Thu Aug 6 17:44:42 2015 -0400

    [ieee80211] Rework QoS Capability and QoS info code.
    
    Specifically:
    - Replace/remove much of 'dissect_qos_capability()' code to use
      existing 'fixed field' code to dissect QoS_Info field.
      Note: Much of the code added in g40d6131 to dissect the QoS Info
            field duplicated already existing (but unused) "fixed field"
            code to do same.
    - Rework some QoS Info field filter names, variable names and
      value-strings to better match the text used in 802.11-2012.
    
    - Rename 'dissect_qos_info()' to 'dissect_wme_qos_info()' to
      reflect the fact that this code is only for the (now preumably obsolete)
      original WME(WMM) specification for the QoS Info field.

    The length of an OCT MMPDU is 16 bits, not 8 bits, and it's not a text

    The Beacon Interval Control is 48 bits, not 64 bits.
    
    Handle the beam refinement UI as a 2-byte field that overlaps with a
    4-byte field - *none* of the bitfields align on nice 8-bit boundaries,

Date:   Wed Aug 5 13:00:38 2015 -0700

    Clean up some fields.
    
    The "LEN" field is the "length of the MAC frame", in bytes; confusingly,
    it includes the extended header length, but not the fixed-length part of
    the header (including the FCS), so it's not the "length after HCS".
    
    Rename it to "docsis.len", as it's always LEN, not SID; there's a
    separate field for the SID.
    
    Rename the Extended Header Length field to docsis.ehdrlen, and the
    Number of Concatenated Frames to docsis.concat_cnt, so that different
    uses of the "MACPARM" part of the header are flagged differently.
    
    Update some comments while we're at it.

    Use an ellipsis character instead of three dots.
    
    The OS X Human Interface Guidelines at
    
    https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/TerminologyWording.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH15-SW3
    
    says:
    
    "Be sure to create the ellipsis character using the key combination
     Option-; (Option-semicolon). This ensures that an assistive app can
     provide the correct interpretation of the character to a disabled user.
     If you use three period characters to simulate an ellipsis, many
     assistive apps will be unable to make sense of them. Also, three period
     characters and an ellipsis don't look the same because the periods are
     spaced differently than the points of an ellipsis."
    
    The Windows desktop applications guidelines has a section on ellipses:
    
    https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742478.aspx
    
    but doesn't specify the a single glyph vs three dots.
    
    The GNOME HIG at
    
    https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/typography.html.en
    
    says "Take Advantage of Unicode" then specifically says to use U+2026
    HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS.
    
    Remove the ellipsis from "Find Next" and "Find Previous". Neither
    requires user interaction.

    SMB2: only move ssi for request if request is really complete
    
    MS-SMB2 section '3.2.5.1.5 Handling Asynchronous Responses' states
    
      "If SMB2_FLAGS_ASYNC_COMMAND is set in the Flags field of the SMB2
       header and Status is not STATUS_PENDING, this is a final response
       to a request which was processed by the server asynchronously"
    
    This patch delays moving ssi information for a processed request
    to the matched hashmap until the request is actually completed.
    Without this patch the ssi information for the *final* matching
    message id response will not be available (on first pass) so a
    subdissector (e.g. MS-WSP) will not have the ssi information available
    to it. After this patch the ssi infomation will remain in the 'unmatched'
    hashmap until the 'final' response for the request is seen. While
    processing the 'final' matching response the ssi will be moved to
    the matched hashmap.

    Fix an error where we expect the tagged parameters field to be present even
    though the spec (802.11ad-2012) says they are optional.
    
    Communicated to me by the WiFi Alliance. I have captures. Not sure if I can
    share them.

    ISAKMP: The modecfg attribute type INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS is not decoded correctly
    
    According to RFC7296, section 3.15.1:
    
    "The INTERNAL_IP6_ADDRESS is made up of two fields: the first is a 16-octet IPv6 address, and the second is a one-octet prefix-length as defined in [ADDRIPV6]."
    
    In the code, the type is declared as FT_IPv4 and the field is decoded only if it has 16 bytes. Instead, it should be declared as FT_IPv6 and the first 16 bytes should be added to the tree.

    DNS: move DNS name resolution pref to Name Resolution prefs
    
    Move the boolean flag for using captured DNS packet info for name resolution
    to the Name Resolution preferences settings, as it was rather surprising to
    disable Name Resolution preferences and still have names being resolved. Also
    disble them all if the '-n' command line switch is used, and re-enable it for
    a 'd' character in the '-N' option.

    MSWSP: Initial implementation of MS-WSP (windows search protocol) dissector
    
    This changeset is a forward port of Gregors ms-wsp branch from his
    repo http://repo.or.cz/w/wireshark-wip.git. Most of the messages of
    the MS-WSP protocol are implemented here and as such consists of the
    majority of the changes for the dissector.
    
    In addition to the forward porting Gregors work I added some extra bits
    1) cater for SMB2 Read Response and Write Request msgs that can also
       contain MSWSP messages
    2) update property specifications with info extracted from MS-WSP protocol
       doc
    3) store some basic data about previously seen messages that are needed
       for dissecting CPMGetRows request
    4) expand/update dissect_CPMSetBindings & parse_CTableColumn routines
    5) parse and store CTableColumn & CPMSetBindingsIn structures in conversation
       related data for use later.
    6) fully dissect/parse SeekDesciption of CPMGetRowsOut
    7) dissect CPMGetRows out message specifically the Rows & Columns
    8) flesh out the boolean properties of uBooleanOptions field
    9) flesh out various other dissectors:
    	CPMRatioFinished
    	CPMRestartPosition
    	CPMCompareBmkIn/CPMCompareBmkOut
    	CPMGetApproximatePosition
    	CPMGetSendNotifyOut
    	FindIndicesIn/Out
    	FetchValue
