Date:   Sat May 16 05:08:53 2015 -0400

    switch to AC_PATH_TOOL
    
    The TOOL variant will automatically search for host prefixed scripts
    (e.g. armv7a-unknown-linux-gnueabi-pcap-config) before falling back
    to the default (i.e. pcap-config).  This makes cross-compiling a bit
    simpler.

    Windows: don't attempt to set the capture buffer size on remote (rpcap) devices.
    
    Also move the code for setting the buffer size on Windows near the code for
    setting it when we have pcap_create(): into open_capture_device().

    Don't warn about overwriting filename preferences.
    
    When specifying a filename preference (e.g. the SSL pre-master secret
    log filename) don't warn about overwriting the file. Most of the time
    we're reading the file and when we're not (e.g. for the SSL debug log)
    overwriting it is kind of the point.
    
    Preference descriptions are plain text. We display them in tooltips as
    rich text. Convert them accordingly.
    
    Fixup some of the SSL preference descriptions.

    Don't just blindly tell application X11 to do anything.
    
    Determine what type of X11 (bundled from Apple, unbundled XQuartz) we
    should have and what type we do have.
    
    If we don't have any installed, don't tell X11 to do anything, as that
    just pops up a "where is X11?" dialog; that's information the user
    shouldn't need to tell the system if it is installed, and it's
    information for which the user shouldn't be asked if it's not installed
    - and if they're asked, they might answer incorrectly, leaving a system
    that doesn't properly launch X11 for Wireshark.  (See various
    ask.wireshark.org questions about this, for example.)
    
    Pick up some changes from newer versions of Inkscape, such as using
    unsigned char *, not using FSSpecs, and adding some comments, while
    we're at it.

    Also, rename "NTLM Client Challenge" to "LMv2 Client Challenge", as
    that's what it is (ChallengeFromClient from 2.2.2.4 LMv2_RESPONSE), and
    rename "Client Challenge" to "NTLMv2 Client Challenge", as that's what
    *it* is (ChallengeFromClient from 2.2.2.7 NTLM v2:
    NTLMv2_CLIENT_CHALLENGE).

commit 65b17d4
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon May 18 10:00:58 2015 -0700

    Reorganize the NTLMSSP blob and AUTHENTICATE message parsing.
    
    The "result" argument to dissect_ntlmssp_blob() is never null, so don't
    check for it being null.
    
    Have separate clauses for LmChallengeResponse and NtChallengeResponse,
    and do the checks for NTLMv1 vs. NTLMv2 inside those clauses.
    
    Do the copy to client_challenge within the AUTHENTICATE message parsing
    only if we've already determined that it's an NTLMv2 message.
    
    Add some comments to better explain what's being done and to ask some
    questions.

    Don't put an expert info on every single raw frame (even if it was just a Note).
    
    It's completely normal that there's no link information when you're dissecting
    raw packets.  This does leave the Raw protocol tree without any children
    (which looks a little funny) but I don't want to take it out and I don't see
    anything useful to put under it.
    
    Also change the Raw protocol item to cover all the bytes of the TVB (like the
    frame item).

    Make a union of the 4 bytes of the address and the address as a 32-bit

    interior or exterior route.  Rather than just casting a pointer to a
    byte to a pointer to a 4-byte integer - which may not be safe, as the

    of the union.

    giop: ignore NULL-terminator in CDR strings
    
    CDR strings appear to be both counted *and* NULL-terminated in many cases,
    which is rather weird, so if we see a NULL-terminator, ignore it in the count;
    otherwise we print a trailing '\000' on all the strings we put in the tree.

commit 42611db
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sun May 10 14:16:14 2015 -0700

    Try wrapping some tshark invocations in a script to catch crashes.
    
    Add a script that takes a command as an argument and runs it in a
    subshell, so that said subshell will catch any signals from it and
    report it.
    
    This would be done for commands that aren't the last command in the
    pipeline, as, given that the exit status of a pipeline is the exit
    status of the last command in the pipeline, there's no guarantee that
    the shell will bother to pick up the exit status of earlier commands in
    the pipeline.
    
    Use that for the tshark in the WPA EAPOL Rekey test, so it at least can
    report the signal (on Solaris, SIGSEGV means, among other things,
    "dereferenced a pointer pointing out of the address space" and SIGBUS
    means, among other things, "dereferenced a misaligned pointer on
    SPARC").  Maybe we can make the script also fire up a debugger if it
    finds a core dump (and a debugger) and get a stack trace.

    Pick array sizes based on what they're supposed to hold.
    
    In AirPDcapRsnaPwd2PskStep(), digest[] holds an SSID plus 4 bytes of
    count, so the size is MAX_SSID_LENGTH plus 4, and digest1[] holds an
    SHA-1 digest, so the size is SHA1_DIGEST_LEN.
    
    That makes it a bit clearer why those are the sizes.

    Expert Info dialog.
    
    Show all expert messages in a combined view. Group top-level items by a
    (severity, group, protocol) tuple.
    
    Let the user enable and disable messages via a check menu.
    
    Add ProtoTree::goToField and expert_info_t.hf_index. Use them to jump to
    what we hope is the afflicted item.
    
    Enable the context menu only if the user has selected a packet item.
    
    Add a free-form search field that matches expert summaries.
    
    This differs from the GTK+ version but hopefully provides a smoother
    workflow.

commit 1439eb6
Author: deagol <alexander.wetzel@web.de>
Date:   Fri May 1 22:56:50 2015 +0200

    IEEE 802.11: 802.1X (WPA-EAP) rekeying support
    
    This patch extends the existing decryption support for WPA to also
    handle rekeys by checking each decrypted packet for a 4-way-handshake.
    
    Rekeys can be used for WPA-PSK, but are more common with WPA-Enterprise
    (WPA-EAP).
    
    For decrypting WPA-EAP secured packets the user must provide all used PMK's
    of the connection (aka PSK's) as WPA-PSK 32 byte hex values to wireshark
    via the existing interface.
    (The capture must have all 4-way-handshakes included also, starting with
    the first unencrypted one.)
    
    Every decrypted unicast packet will habe the used PMK and TK shown in the
    CCMP/TKIP section below the key index in the GUI. Group packets will display the
    GTK instead.
    
    Additionally this fixes a small issue with group rekey handling, so every packet
    can be selected in the GUI in random order, removing the need to manually find
    the correct group keying packets prior to that.
    
    It was tested primary with WPA-CCMP, but TKIP is also working.
    
    One section in the code touch bluetooth 802.1X support. It should do
    exactly the same, but will now also examine all decypted packets for rekeys.

    If building with Wireshark wasn't explicitly disabled - i.e., if we are
    building Wireshark, which means we are building an application with a
    GUI - and Qt was explicitly disabled, and neither GTK+ 2 nor GTK+ 3 were
    explicitly enabled, look for GTK+ 3.

    GTK UI: remove eo_saveable_pathname in favor of eo_massage_str
    
    The function had several deficiencies:
    
    - When "" is passed as the filename, the function returns a null
      pointer (due to the quirky behavior of g_strsplit_set), which causes a
      segfault when it's dereferenced later. I'm not sure what the correct
      return should be, but it shouldn't be NULL.
    
    - It leaks memory. (The array of strings returned by
      g_strsplit_set are never freed.)
    
    - It only strips out backslashes. That is not the only character that
      is disallowed in filenames, even on windows.
    
    - The functionality is already provided by eo_massage_str and
      it does a more complete job of it.

Date:   Sat Apr 25 20:29:30 2015 -0700

    Add support for IPv6 heuristic dissectors.
    
    This adds limited support for heuristic subdissectors with IPv6.
    The initial motivation is STT but it should transparently work
    for other protocols using IP heuristic dissectors in a manner
    similar to the non-heuristic dissectors.
    
    The limitation is in regards to IPv6 extension headers. IPv6 has
    multiple checks against the next protocol table when determining
    when the protocol is an unknown extension header or not. This
    assumes that the check is cheap and has no side effects, neither
    of which is true for heuristic dissectors. As a compromise, this
    assumes that the next protocol is registered as protocol, even
    if is not the one that is ultimately dissected. Although not
    strictly correct, in practice this is true for existing protocols
    and likely future ones because the heuristic dissectors are
    overriding non-heuristic ones.

    Expand comments.
    
    Update a URL, and tell The Story About PIM, or, at least, about various
    drafts floating around.  I guess it took a while for the protocol to
    settle down, and a number of things changed significantly between early
    drafts and RFC 2117, including whether the protocol runs atop IGMP or
    directly atop IP.
    
    There doesn't appear to be *any* draft that corresponds to what
    dissect_pimv1() dissects; all have significant differences.

commit b849726
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Apr 30 20:03:39 2015 -0700

    Fix some cases where we're shifting a signed 1 left.
    
    Shift 1U instead, to make sure it's unsigned; the result of, for
    example, the result of shifting a signed value left is undefined if the
    value times 2^{shift count} doesn't fit in the *signed* type of the
    shifted value.  That means, in particular, that the result of shifting 1
    left by {number of bits in an int - 1} is undefined.  (In *practice*,
    it'll probably be -2^32, with the bit you want set, but that's not
    guaranteed, and GCC 5.1 seems not to like it.)
    
    Make some other left-hand operands of <<, and some variables holding
    results from shifts of that sort, unsigned, while we're at it.

    Reorganize some of the Diameter XML files, taking advantage of the fact that
    AVPs can be grouped by Vendor now (not just by Application).
    
    Move a bunch of vendor-specific Application IDs to the vendor's XML file.
    
    Delete the (basically empty) SKT.xml, ChinaTelecom.xml, and VerizonWireless.xml
    files.
    
    Fix a typo: 16777224 is 3GPP Gx, not 3GPP Cx.
    
    Use (derived) type Enumerated (rather than Unsigned32 or Integer32) when the
    AVP is of type Enumerated.

    Add service_response_time_table for TShark srt stats.
    
    This is a "refactoring part 1" of the srt stats.  This first step is using the service_response_time_table for all (possible) TShark srt stats.  Next step will be combining the GTK and TShark service_response_time_table, so there is more code reuse and the "shared structure names" between GTK and TShark service_response_time_table won't seem as bad.
    
    Maybe it can even go one step farther and handle a dynamic number of columns so this refactoring can apply to all srt stats.

    c15ch: check packet sanity before allocating
    
    The 'num_digits' parameter to add_digits_string_info_col can come straight from
    the packet. Verify it is sane (e.g. the number of bytes required are actually
    present) as otherwise we can try and allocate enourmous quantities of memory for
    no reason.
    
    Also clean up the routine; fix indenting, and simplify the loop variables.

    Fix filtering on IP heuristic subdissectors.
    
    The IP dissector passes 'tree' to its heuristic dissectors instead
    of the 'parent_tree' passed to the normally registered dissectors.
    These two are generally the same except that 'tree' is set to NULL
    in cases where IP is not referenced - a local optimization that
    should not be passed down to the lower layers. The result is that
    the filter:
    ip && PROTO matches
    but:
    PROTO does not match.
    
    This changes the two types of dissectors to behave the same by
    getting 'parent_tree'.

    Allow the definition of AVPs within vendor IDs.
    
    This allows for a more natural organization of AVP definitions: they can now
    be grouped by application (including the base application) or vendor ID. This
    means we can stop using the "workaround" (for those vendors who define AVPs
    but don't have their own application ID) of finding some random application ID
    to put in a vendor-specific xml file just to satisfy the parser.
    
    Rework a couple of Vendor-specific xml files as an example.
    
    Note: this does mean that vendor IDs can no longer be defined inside of the
    base or other application.  If that's a problem the parser could be made
    (through some duplication of code) to understand the old format too.

    Calculate *Peek tagged timestamps in fixed-point.
    
    Add a variant of filetime_to_nstime() that takes a value that's like a
    FILETIME but in units of nanoseconds rather than tenths of a
    microsecond, and use that.  (It looks as if they might just get FILETIME
    values from the OS and multiply them by 100, as the nanosecond-FILETIME
    values appear to be multiples of 100 in the captures I've seen, but they
    might have chosen nanosecond resolution in case they need to support a
    higher-resolution time stamp source, so we don't assume that the values
    will always be a multiple of 100.)

commit ff4ca0a
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 20 00:13:55 2015 -0700

    Simplify the calculation of the time stamp.
    
    The time is calculated based on a 32-bit "seconds since the Epoch" value
    for the start time and a 32-bit delta from that time, in milliseconds.
    We can just split that delta into seconds and milliseconds, add the
    seconds to the start time to get the seconds part of the time stamp, and
    multiply the milliseconds by 1,000,000 to get the nanoseconds part of
    the time stamp.  The only 64-bit arithmetic needed is adding the seconds
    to a 64-bit version of the start time (just in case seconds+start time
    goes past Y2.038K).

    Download the Qt dmg and just do a binary installation.
    
    That's a *lot* faster than building from source.
    
    That means we should suggest adding the Qt pkg-config directory to
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH; do so.

    Amazingly, "hdiutil attach" can take a URL as an argument; it will
    attempt to download the file in question and mount it.  We've already
    downloaded the file, so there's no point in downloading it again
    (especially not with a URL with "v2.8" coded in).

    giop: fix uninitialized use of request id
    
    Move the req_id field to the "message-dependent data" section of the header
    struct, since in the spec I found it is not specified in the common GIOP header
    (even though it appears to be present in all message types). Regardless, this
    better reflects the fact that it is not initialized by the primary tvb_memcpy,
    only the independent fields are.
    
    Initialize it and use it rather than creating a local for no reason; fixes the
    possibility of using it uninitialized.

    Start moving win-setup to PowerShell.
    
    Add win-setup.ps1, which duplicates the following tasks performed by
    config.nmake + Makefile.nmake + win-setup.sh:
    
    - Create the windows library directory.
    - Download files.
    - Download and unpack zip files.
    - Check and set current-tag.txt
    
    Don't verify applications or libraries. CMakeLists.txt does that.
    
    Update the Developer's Guide.
    
    Have POWERSHELL_COMMAND use dot sourcing instead of "-File", which
    appears to be a synonym for "-IgnoreTheExitStatusReturnedByThisScript".
    
    This removes our dependencies on unzip and wget and reduces our dependency
    on bash.

    Bluetooth: OBEX: Fix reassemble at transport layer
    
    Transport layer is RFCOMM. OBEX packet may be fragmented over RFCOMM.
    If so then (Opcode + Final flag + ) Packet Length determines packet length,
    but whole OBEX packet will be framented over parts/packet that first packet
    has Packet Length and next packets are sequential parts of whole packet
    (no header, etc.) Reassemble on this level is simple concatenation of all packet
    up to Packet Length. Let threat packet shorted than 3 bytes as bad packet.
    
    There is still no reasssemble on OBEX level (aka Final flag), so content send
    over OBEX (vCards, files, XMLs) is still not reassembled.

    UI: Implementing menus for plugins
    
     Plugins may utilize the tap interface to provide special tools
     or analysis options, not otherwise available in Wireshark, or
     perhaps not allowed to be distributed freely. Up until now, those
     tools either had to start automatically, or could not be started
     at all, or had to be started separately.
    
     It should be possible, that those tools may be started using a
     menu entry directly from Wireshark. This interface tries to achieve
     exactly that.
    
     This interface uses a clean interface, which can be implemented in
     any plugin or dissector. Documentation for this has been added to
     README.plugins.
    
     Separators are only supported for now in the Qt interface, but
     URLs can now be added as a simple item, and the UI will use the
     same methods used for other URL calls to open them.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Sat Apr 11 21:07:24 2015 -0700

    Only add flags to CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD if $CC and $CC_FOR_BUILD are the same.
    
    Otherwise, just because a flag is appropriate for $CC, that doesn't
    necessarily mean it's appropriate for $CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD.
    
    (We don't use CFLAGS_FOR_BUILD for many things, so it's probably not
    worth making a lot of effort to throw all the warning flags into it if
    we're cross-compiling; we *do* throw them in for native compilation,
    which is what most developers use and test with, so that should be
    sufficient to let the warnings catch problems with the build tools we're
    building.)

    that much of anybody cares about it any more), or it's UN*X or Windows-

    Revert parts of g2ef72cb and g7710da4 so that the NSIS installer once
    again places plugins in $INSTDIR\plugins\$VERSION. This matches the
    behavior of Autotools and previous Windows installers, and reduces the
    chances of a version mismatch if the user happens to install a custom
    plugin.
    
    Leave the development plugin path unversioned. Leave the extcap path
    unversioned for now.

Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Mon Apr 6 12:14:25 2015 -0700

    Keep a captured-packet count in a capture_session and use that.
    
    Have the count in a cfile_t structure always reflect the actual number
    of packets that have been read from the file, rather than, when doing a
    non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time capture, falsely increasing the
    count in the cfile_t to reflect the number of packets captured but not
    yet read.
    
    Have the status bar base its captured-packet count on the count in the
    capture_session structure, and base the "sorry, no packets were
    captured" message on the count in the capture_session structure, as
    we're no longer using the count in the cfile_t structure to count
    anything in the process of a non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time
    capture.
    
    That way, we preserve the invariant that the "frames" member of a
    cfile_t will be non-null if the "count" member is non-zero, fixing bug
    6217.
    
    It also means we can get rid of cf_set_packet_count(), as we only set
    the count in the capture-file-reading code.

    Show a list of interfaces on the welcome screen when capturing.
    
    In a non-update-list-of-packets-in-real-time capture, once the capture
    starts, put up a message on the welcome screen indicating on what
    interfaces we're capturing, rather than leaving the "waiting for stuff
    to arrive from dumpcap" message up.
    
    Make some routines not used outside main_welcome.c static while we're at
    it.

    Have a common routine for constructing strings listing interfaces.
    
    We have a bunch of duplicated code to make those lists; make a common
    routine for that.  (dumpcap currently doesn't use it, as the routine in
    question uses a routine in libui, which dumpcap doesn't use.  We should
    probably fix that.)

    Fix IMF Dissector
    
    The IMF dissector doesn't properly handle the extra CRLF between
    the headers and the body, leaving it as part of the last header,
    and then fails to obtain the body contents due to incorrectly
    specifying the length of the remaining data.

    802.11: EAPOL 4-way handshake information wrong
    
    the EAPOL Key Exchange descriptions show key packets 2 and 4 as "Key (Message 4 of 4)"
    
    Reason of issue :
     In the IEEE 802.11 specification the value for the counter is defined as following:
    Message #2 - counter = n
    Message #4 - counter = n+1
    So the only way to distinguish between message #2 and message #4 using the counter value would be for Wireshark to "look ahead" and compare the counter values (e.g., if counter1 < counter2, then message 2, else message 4).
    
    Fix :
    However, there is a much easier way to distinguish between message #2 and message #4.  Instead of using the counter field, Wireshark could parse the "WPA Key Nonce" field (display filter = wlan_rsna_eapol.keydes.nonce).
    According to the IEEE specification, sections 11.6.6.3 and 11.6.6.5 define the value for the WPA Key Nonce as following:
    Message #2, Key Nonce = SNonce (Supplicant Nonce)
    Message #4, Key Nonce = 0
    So, the logic would be:
    1. Use the Wireshark parser to determine the WPA Key Nonce value.  The Key nonce field is 32 octets.
    2. If !(keynonce), then message #2
        Else message #4
    (Only check the first 4 octets of nonce if equal to zero)

    Work around a Linux bonding driver bug (and the lack of a libpcap workaround).
    
    The bonding driver does not properly handle unknown ioctls; it returns
    ENODEV rather than ENOTSUP, EOPNOTSUPP, ENOTTY, or a "not supported"
    error of that type.  This causes problems detailed in bug 11058.
    
    On Linux, check for bonding devices before checking for monitor-mode
    support.
    
    While we're at it, get rid of a commented-out include of
    CheckCSourceCompiles (it's presumably already been implicitly included
    by other functions that use it).

    DTLS: use addresses_ports_reassembly_table_functions

    fragments for the second session report a error:
    
    > [Reassembly error, protocol DTLS: New fragment overlaps old data (retransmission?)]
    
    It turns out that the DTLS dissector uses the addresses_reassembly_table_functions
    which takes only the IP addresses into account and not the ports.
    Changing that to the addresses_ports_reassembly_table_functions
    fixes the bogus error message.

    html2text.py: Python 2.5 compatibility, improve Unicode support
    
    Add support for Python 2.5 (remove unicode_literals import which does
    not seem to be necessary), check before using break_on_hyphens (without
    this option in Python 2.5, the output is uglier though) and avoid the
    'with' keyword.
    
    While at it, fix reading Unicode text from file in Python 2 (tested
    with: echo € | tools/html2text.py) and support reading from stdin using
    the '-' filename.
    
    Tested against Python 2.5.6, 2.6.6, 2.7.9, 3.2.6, 3.4.3 with the
    commands from the previous html2text.py commit message, and additionally
    with the Unicode character € as input (instead of the faq.py output).

    Support WS_BIN_PATH and SOURCE_DIR (modelled after test/config.sh) to

    (2.7.9 and 3.4.3 were also tested fully, but some cases seem to fail

    Always use html2text.py for FAQ, improve output
    
    A recent commit broke compilation with Python 3. The original author of
    html2text.py is deceased and the fork has increased the number of files
    for this "simple" helper.
    
    The html2text.py script in this patch was rewritten and its output
    matches with lynx (except for a few newlines around lists). This means
    that indentation has been added for headings, paragraphs and lists.
    Also, since it was written from scratch, a new license could be chosen
    that matches Wireshark.
    
    Since now the in-tree html2text.py script provides nicer output, remove
    detection of the alternative programs (elinks, links). lynx/w3m is
    somehow still necessary for asciidoc though.
    
    (I also looked into reusing html2text.py for the release notes to
    replace asciidoc, but the --format=html output produces different output
    (HTML adds a ToC and section numbers). For now still require lynx for
    release notes)
    
    Tested with Python 2.6.6, 2.7.9, 3.2.6 and 3.4.3 under LC_ALL=C and
    LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 on Linux. Tested reading from stdin and file, writing
    to file, pipe and tty. Tested with cmake (Ninja) and autotools on Arch
    Linux x86_64. Test:
    
        # For each $PATH per python version, execute (with varying LC_ALL)
        help/faq.py -b | tools/html2text.py /dev/stdin | md5sum
        help/faq.py -b | tools/html2text.py | md5sum

    have pcap_create() (in which case we also have pcap_set_buffer_size(),
    at least in a normal libpcap release).
    
    Use that rather than testing "defined(_WIN32) ||
    defined(HAVE_PCAP_CREATE)"; that makes it a bit more obvious what's
    being tested.

commit 77bc38e
Author: Guy Harris <guy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 24 18:30:01 2015 -0700

    Clean up handling of buffer size.
    
    Instead of a twisty little maze of #if, #ifdefs, and #elifs, all
    different, define HAVE_BUFFER_SIZE upfront iff we can set the buffer
    size - i.e., if this is Win32, and thus we're using WinPcap, or if we
    have pcap_create() and thus pcap_set_buffer_size() - and use that to
    govern whether to have a buffer size setting or not.
    
    Always put the buffer size setting in the right vertical box.  If that
    doesn't work well for some configurations of available interface knobs,
    feel free to change the checks, but please make it less opaque what's
    going on (include a comment if necessary).

    Centralize the code to set the active_dlt value for a device.
    
    We were doing it similarly, but not the same, in several places; make a
    common routine for it.
    
    Have that code check to make sure the DLT_ value in question is actually
    supported by the device; if not, pick the first supported DLT_ value, if
    any; this keeps it from, for example, picking a bad DLT_ value if your
    defaults were set based on monitor mode being on but monitor mode
    actually being off, or vice versa.
